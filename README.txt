GOAL of Project:
			The Aim of the study is to understand co2 emissions and then to model it on countries, GDP, Income 
			Level, population and geography
The various steps followed:
			1. Data connectivity: I have loaded the three input files together
			2. Data cleaning: I have removed the missing values
			3. Data merging: Combine the three files
			4. Data preparation: Pre process the data to make it suitable for modeling
			5. Exploratory Data Analysis: Create visualizations and try to understand the trend and other features
			6. Create training and testing data: We sample our data into training and testing data in 90:10 ratio
			7. Modeling: Create Linear Regression and random forest model to understand the co2 emissions as a function of other variables
